# ImersaoCSS 
My personal site and portfolio, developed during the [Imers√£o CSS](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-css/), promoted by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/). :school:

### What was it? :thought_balloon:
It was a program with 5 classes exclusively of HTML and CSS, with the objective of create and develop the student's personal website.

I decided to join and watch it because I completely suck in frontend, and I learned a lot of new things about CSS, which was pretty exciting! After the classes were done, I decided to customize even more my project, and I spent one more week on it, adding new animations and content to it. :smile:

### How to use it? :arrow_forward:

### Credits :raising_hand:
Hi there! My name is Olivia. I'm a web developer, focused on Microsoft technologies (.NET/C# are my favorites). I'm also more a backend girl than everything; I do not have a sharp aesthetic sense, even though this project is great and I'm really proud of it! :sparkles:

Feel free to contact me with any questions, tips or feedbacks about this project. I'll be happy to hear and to reply!
